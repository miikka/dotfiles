# Miikka's dotfiles

This repository holds the configuration files for some programs I frequently
use. I haven't commented them or anything, so don't expect to learn much from
them. I just like to use Github as a place to host them.

Below is a list of some handy extensions I use.

## Shell utilities

* [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) or
  [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) for quickly changing directories.
* [v](https://github.com/rupa/v) for opening recently edited files in Vim.
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for dealing with Ruby versions.

## Vim plugins

* [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for managing Vim plugins.
* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) for quickly finding files and buffers.
