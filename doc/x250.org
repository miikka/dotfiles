#+TITLE: Setting up NixOS on Lenovo Thinkpad X250

Story of my LOL (Linux on Laptop) setup.

* Keyboard [2/3]
** DONE Configure Arkkudvorak
   CLOSED: [2020-04-13 Mon 18:08]
** TODO Configure a with ring in Arkkudvorak
** DONE Configure Caps Lock as Escape
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 16:44]
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   services.xserver.xkbOptions = "caps:escape";
   #+END_SRC
** TODO Configure the media keys
* TODO Figure out how to adjust screen brightness
  This works from command-line, but I want to have be able to use the media keys.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo 500 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Customize i3's status bar
  - Simpler network info would be enough: just show me which wifi I'm connected to
  - No need for the free disk space or swap info either.
  - Showing both batteries would be nice
* TODO Try out i3-gaps
* TODO Figure out how to take screenshots
* DONE Import global git configuration
  CLOSED: [2020-02-18 Tue 20:07]
* Backups [2/3]
** DONE Configure restic for backups
   CLOSED: [2020-02-20 Thu 18:15]
   Let's first try it out interactively:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   nix-env -iA nixos.restic
   #+END_SRC
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   restic init
   restic --verbose --exclude-file=excludes.txt backup "$HOME"
   #+END_SRC

** TODO Store a copy of the backup credentials
** DONE Figure out how to make it run regularly
   CLOSED: [2020-03-07 Sat 17:15]
   I thought that the systemd unit runs at the middle of night and I never have
   the computer open at that time, but if the computer has been suspended, it
   actually runs it in the morning, then. That's fine.
** Postponed: Configure the removal of old backups
   NixOS's restic's pruneOpts is not in 19.09, but it could look like the example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
      pruneOpts = [
        "--keep-daily 7"
        "--keep-weekly 5"
        "--keep-monthly 12"
        "--keep-yearly 75"
      ];
   #+END_SRC
* Dropbox [3/4]
** DONE Install Dropbox

   NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-env -iA nixos.dropbox
   #+END_SRC
** TODO How to start it automatically?
** DONE How to tell what it is doing?
   CLOSED: [2020-02-15 Sat 13:06]
   Dropbox shows up in i3-status-bar as an applet.
** DONE Re-install Dropbox

* SSD upgrade [7/7]
** DONE Find a suitable SSD
   CLOSED: [2020-02-17 Mon 21:57]
   Crucial MX500 seems to have very favorable reviews and good price. 500 GB
   seems like the rigth size for me and the 2.5" SATA model should fit.
** DONE Benchmark the old disk
   CLOSED: [2020-02-17 Mon 22:03]
   I doubt thes benchmarks indicate much, but hey.

   hdparm shows me the disk as a "frozen", so I can't do the secure erase from 
   NixOS live USB stick.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   hdparm -I /dev/sda

   Apparently this is the way to go:

  This is extremely slow, but works:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nix-env -qaP ".*emacs.*"
  #+END_SRC
  This website is a bit faster: https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html?channel=nixos-19.09
  
  The good way to search is:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  nix search emacs

  I mean C-a / C-e etc. Seems too complicated, will have to get by without. :|
* DONE Try out the webcam
  CLOSED: [2020-07-07 Tue 14:41]
** It works in Firefox out of the box!
** For whatever reason, Fx shows the camera twice. Both work, though.
* DONE Install Hugo and other blogging tools
  CLOSED: [2020-02-15 Sat 18:37]
  I need the latest version of Hugo -- the version in 19.09 is too old. So let's
  instable it via unstable:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable unstable
  sudo nix-channel --update
  nix-env -iA unstable.hugo

  # The rest of the tools
  nix-env -iA nixos.graphicsmagick

  nix-env -iA nixos.libwebp
  #+END_SRC

  OMG! Clicking works out of the box!

  One-finger scrolling in Firefox requires two things:
  - In about:config, dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled set to 1 (enabled), not 2 (auto-detect)
  - Start Firefox with environmental variable MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 env firefox
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Try out Powertop
* DONE Try out lorri/direnv
  CLOSED: [2020-07-07 Tue 14:44]
** It's nice and it works.
** Would be even nicer if it didn't print so much stuff when cd'ing to a lorri dir
* TODO Investigate the status of the two batteries
* TODO Figure out how to install git-cal
