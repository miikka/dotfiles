#+TITLE: Setting up NixOS on Lenovo Thinkpad X250

Story of my LOL (Linux on Laptop) setup.

* Keyboard [0/3]
** TODO Configure Arkkudvorak
** TODO Configure Caps Lock as Escape
** TODO Configure the media keys
* TODO Figure out how to adjust screen brightness
  This works from command-line, but I want to have be able to use the media keys.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo 500 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Customize i3's status bar
  - Simpler network info would be enough: just show me which wifi I'm connected to
  - No need for the free disk space or swap info either.
  - Showing both batteries would be nice
* TODO Try out i3-gaps
* TODO Figure out how to take screenshots
* DONE Import global git configuration

* Backups [1/2]
** DONE Configure restic for backups
   CLOSED: [2020-02-20 Thu 18:15]
   Let's first try it out interactively:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   nix-env -iA nixos.restic
   #+END_SRC
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   restic init
   restic --verbose --exclude-file=excludes.txt backup "$HOME"
   #+END_SRC

** TODO Store a copy of the backup credentials
** TODO Figure out how to make it run regularly
   I thought that the systemd unit runs at the middle of night and I never have
   the computer open at that time, but if the computer has been suspended, it
   actually runs it in the morning, then. That's fine.
** TODO Configure the removal of old backups
* Dropbox [2/3]
** DONE Install Dropbox
   CLOSED: [2020-02-15 Sat 12:57]

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-env -iA nixos.dropbox
   #+END_SRC
** TODO How to start it automatically?
** DONE How to tell what it is doing?
   CLOSED: [2020-02-15 Sat 13:06]
   Dropbox shows up in i3-status-bar as an applet.
* TODO Find a graphical file browser
* TODO Install 1Password
* SSD upgrade [7/7]
** DONE Find a suitable SSD
   CLOSED: [2020-02-17 Mon 21:57]
   Crucial MX500 seems to have very favorable reviews and good price. 500 GB
   seems like the rigth size for me and the 2.5" SATA model should fit.
** DONE Benchmark the old disk
   CLOSED: [2020-02-17 Mon 22:03]
   I doubt thes benchmarks indicate much, but hey.

** DONE Wipe the old SSD
   CLOSED: [2020-02-21 Fri 13:57]
   hdparm shows me the disk as a "frozen", so I can't do the secure erase from 
   NixOS live USB stick.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   hdparm -I /dev/sda
   #+END_SRC
   Apparently this is the way to go:

  This is extremely slow, but works:

  nix-env -qaP ".*emacs.*"
  #+END_SRC
  This website is a bit faster: https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html?channel=nixos-19.09
  
  The good way to search is:

  nix search emacs

  I need the latest version of Hugo -- the version in 19.09 is too old. So let's
  instable it via unstable:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable unstable
  sudo nix-channel --update
  nix-env -iA unstable.hugo

  # The rest of the tools

  OMG! Clicking works out of the box!

  One-finger scrolling in Firefox requires two things:
  - In about:config, dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled set to 1 (enabled), not 2 (auto-detect)
  - Start Firefox with environmental variable MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 env firefox
  #+END_SRC
