** TODO Configure the media keys

  This works from command-line, but I want to have be able to use the media keys.

  echo 500 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Customize i3's status bar
  - Simpler network info would be enough: just show me which wifi I'm connected to
  - No need for the free disk space or swap info either.
  - Showing both batteries would be nice
* TODO Try out i3-gaps
* TODO Figure out how to take screenshots
* DONE Import global git configuration

* Backups [1/2]
** DONE Configure restic for backups
   CLOSED: [2020-02-20 Thu 18:15]
   Let's first try it out interactively:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   nix-env -iA nixos.restic
   #+END_SRC
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   restic init
   restic --verbose --exclude-file=excludes.txt backup "$HOME"
   #+END_SRC

** TODO Store a copy of the backup credentials
** TODO Figure out how to make it run regularly
   The systemd unit runs at the middle of night and I never have the computer
   open at that time.

   Crucial MX500 seems to have very favorable reviews and good price. 500 GB
   seems like the rigth size for me and the 2.5" SATA model should fit.
** DONE Benchmark the old disk
   CLOSED: [2020-02-17 Mon 22:03]
   I doubt thes benchmarks indicate much, but hey.

  I need the latest version of Hugo -- the version in 19.09 is too old. So let's
  instable it via unstable:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable unstable
  sudo nix-channel --update
  nix-env -iA unstable.hugo

  OMG! Clicking works out of the box!

  One-finger scrolling in Firefox requires two things:
  - In about:config, dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled set to 1 (enabled), not 2 (auto-detect)
  - Start Firefox with environmental variable MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 env firefox
  #+END_SRC
